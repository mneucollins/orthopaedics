to update forked repository from imbas go to your local repo and issue the following commands
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

If you are getting changes that were committed to a particular branch, I believe you will need to change to that branch on your local machine and issue these same commands (swapping out "master" with the name of the branch), for example
git branch new-master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/new-master

That will update the local copy which then needs to be pushed up to the forked copy on github
git push
